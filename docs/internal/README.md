Documentation for contributors and development process.

## [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](./adrs/)

We use ADRs to document significant architectural decisions. Every major feature starts as an ADR.

**Process:**
1. Create an ADR before implementing
2. Review and refine the plan
3. If issues are found, fix the ADR first
4. Implement only when the plan is solid
5. Update the ADR if implementation reveals new insights

See [ADR Template](./adrs/000-template.md) for the format.

## [Dev Notes](./dev-notes/)

Research, experiments, and implementation notes that don't fit the ADR format.
