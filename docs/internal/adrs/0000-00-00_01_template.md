## Issue

Describe the architectural design issue you're addressing, leaving no questions about why you're addressing this issue now. State the problem in one or two sentences.

## Decision

Clearly state the architectural direction chosen. Be specific about what will be built and how.

## Status

**Proposed** | Accepted | Implemented | Superseded | Deprecated

## Group

Category for organizing related decisions: Core, Parsing, Rendering, Navigation, UI

## Assumptions

List the underlying assumptions about the environment and context:
- Technology constraints
- Team capabilities
- Time/budget factors
- Dependencies on other systems

## Constraints

Environmental limitations that the chosen alternative must work within:
- Technical constraints (browser support, bundle size, etc.)
- Business constraints (timeline, resources)
- External dependencies

## Positions

List all viable alternatives considered. For each position:
1. **Position name**: Brief description
   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

This prevents later questions about why certain options weren't considered.

## Argument

Explain why the chosen position was selected over the alternatives. Cover:
- Technical merit
- Implementation complexity
- Resource requirements
- Risk assessment
- Alignment with project goals

## Implications

Describe downstream effects of this decision:
- What new decisions will need to be made?
- What requirements change?
- What training or documentation is needed?
- What technical debt might this create?
